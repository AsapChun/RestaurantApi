# Restaurant API

A restaurant application that accepts menu items from various serving staff in the restaurant. This application must then store the item along with a cooking time for the item to be completed. The application must be able to give a quick snapshot of any or all items on its list at any time. It must also be able to remove specific orders from the list of orders on demand.

## Installation

IDE: [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

Framework: [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)

For building and running the application you need the following:
- [JDK 18](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk18-archive-downloads.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running Locally
There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the Application class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:
```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
